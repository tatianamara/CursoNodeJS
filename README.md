This project was created during the Complete guide of NodeJS by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller  

It's a project of an online shop that includes checkout and payment functionalities.  

During this course, I could learn how to work with Files, use MVC Pattern, use Node.js with SQL, Sequelize, NoSQL, and Mongoose.
I also learned about session and cookies, and how to make user authentication and authorization.  

## How to run the project?
After cloning the project, access it via your terminal and run the commands:

`npm install`  
`npm start`
